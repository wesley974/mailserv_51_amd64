            <p><strong>Round Robin:</strong>   Distributes outgoing traffic using a round-robin scheduler
                              through all active ports and accepts incoming traffic from
                              any active port.</p>

            <p><strong>Failover:</strong>     Sends and receives traffic only through the master port.  If
                              the master port becomes unavailable, the next active port is
                              used.  The first interface added is the master port; any in-
                              terfaces added after that are used as failover devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Load Balance:</strong>  Balances outgoing traffic across the active ports based on
                              hashed protocol header information and accepts incoming
                              traffic from any active port.  The hash includes the Ether-
                              net source and destination address, and, if available, the
                              VLAN tag, and the IP source and destination address.</p>

            <p><strong>None:</strong>         This protocol is intended to do nothing: it disables any
                              traffic without disabling the trunk interface itself.</p>
